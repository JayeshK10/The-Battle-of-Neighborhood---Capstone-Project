It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting places when they move around the globe. Here we find  similar cities between London , New York and Toronto.\n\nThese three are the most densely populated cities around their region. Lots of people move around these cities. This project is for people to move around the world and still find the similar places to those which they are used to living.\nFor ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n\nThis Capstone project aims to create an analysis for people migrating to other parts of the world by comparative analysis between neighborhoods of cities. The features include summations of kinds of venues available in the neighborhood. \n\nIt will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life."
